# ScraperJS

### Node app that scrapes different sites for job listings and writes those listings to DynamoDB

### The UI which is built in react is under the scraper-ui directory

Currently the site scrapes Indeed, Craigslist and StackOverflow with terms passed in by the user. The Craigslist boards searched by the scraper are the ones related to software development. I plan to add some more sites..
